      "Description: The Job Market is Challenging due to more than 150,000 Tech Layoffs in 2022 and in 2023 more than 240,000 layoffs so almost 3,90,00 tech employees have been laid off since 2022 and its still going on . The effect of this has led hundreds of thousands of laid off Tech employees competing with existing Jobseekers. Entry level Job seekers struggle to get responses to their applications, are getting... ghosted after interviews.
